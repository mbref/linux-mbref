dm-switch
=========

dm-switch target is suitable for Dell EqualLogic storage system.

The EqualLogic storage consists of several nodes. Each host is connected
to each node. The host may send I/O requests to any node, the node that
received the requests forwards it to the node where the data is stored.

However, there is a performance advantage of sending I/O requests to the
node where the data is stored to avoid forwarding. The dm-switch targets
is created to use this performance advantage.

The dm-switch target splits the device to fixed-size regions. It maintains
a redirection table that maps regions to storage nodes. Every request is
forwarded to the corresponding storage node specified in the redirection
table. The table may be changed with messages while the dm-switch target
is running.


Construction Parameters
=======================

    <num_nodes> <region_size> <num_optional_arguments>
    for each node: <device_name> <offset>

<num_nodes>
    The number of nodes in the EqualLogic storage.

<region_size>
    The number of 512-byte sectors in a page. Each page can be redirected
    to a specified node.

<num_optional_arguments>
    The number of optional arguments. Currently, there are no optional
    arguments possible and it must be zero.

<device_name>
    The block device that is used to access the specific node.

<offset>
    The offset of data start on the specific node (in the unit of
    512-byte sectors). This number is added to the sector number when
    forwarding the request to the specific node. Typically, it is zero.


Messages
========

set_region_mappings <index>:<node> [<index>]:<node> [<index>]:<node>...

Modify the region table - set which regions are redirected to which nodes.

<index>
    Hexadecimal argument.
    The region number (region size was specified in constructor parameters).
    If index is omitted, a next region (previous index + 1) is used

<node>
    Hexadecimal argument.
    The number number (in the range 0 ... <num_nodes> - 1)


Status
======

There is no status line.


Example
=======

Assume that you have volumes vg1/switch0 vg1/switch1 vg1/switch2 with
the same size.

Create a switch device with 64kB region size:
    dmsetup create switch --table "0 `blockdev --getsize /dev/vg1/switch0`
	switch 3 128 0 /dev/vg1/switch0 0 /dev/vg1/switch1 0 /dev/vg1/switch2 0"

Set mappings for the first 7 entries to point to devices switch0, switch1,
switch2, switch0, switch1, switch2, switch1:
    dmsetup message switch 0 set_region_mappings 0:1 :2 :0 :1 :2 :0 :1
